    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
        For Application 6, I worked within a simulated real-world scenario: stepping into my 
        dream job as a software engineer at a tech company in Central Florida. The company 
        tasked me with developing a real-time system, where timing is just as important as 
        correctness. These systems must not only produce accurate outputs, but must also meet 
        strict timing deadlines to avoid degraded performance, unexpected behavior, or even 
        critical system failures.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this scenario, I contributed to a healthcare technology project. This setting mirrors 
        real medical device development, where tasks often require precise timing—such as 
        delivering insulin at the correct moment or triggering an alarm within seconds of detecting 
        an abnormal patient vital. Real-time systems like pacemakers operate under hard timing 
        constraints, where missing a deadline could be life-threatening. This project emphasized 
        designing reliable, responsive, and time-sensitive software consistent with the demands 
        of professional embedded systems engineering.
